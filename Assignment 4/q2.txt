Table 1. Runtime given number of threads for string of size 100000000

# Discussion

As we can see in table 1, a speedup can be noticed as the number of threads increase. The parallel schema
involved creating a state mapping for each thread, where the final state is calculated for each possible
starting state. Once all threads have finished computing, we sequentially go through each mapping with the
final correct starting state for each segment, to end up with the final state. 

The experiments were performed on an Intel i5-1235U 10 cores 12 logical processors machine.
